# Requirements
# General

.A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

. For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram

. This project will be manually reviewed:

. As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green

. Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).

. For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file

. After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session

. Focus on what you are being asked:

. Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project

. Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements

. Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details 
is necessary - speaking too much can play against you

. In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
