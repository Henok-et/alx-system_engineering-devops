# Project overview 
Project 0x09 revolves around the intricate domain of web infrastructure design, interweaving essential elements from the realms of DevOps and System Administration. At its core, this project delves into the meticulous orchestration of technology, bridging the gap between development and operations to construct robust digital architectures. By synergizing the art of DevOps with the science of SysAdmin, it navigates the challenges of scalability, security, and performance optimization inherent to web ecosystems. It's a captivating journey where meticulous planning converges with real-time adaptability, ensuring the seamless flow of data, applications, and services, ultimately fostering an efficient and resilient web infrastructure that's ready to meet the demands of today's dynamic digital landscape.
# Requirements
# General

.A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

. For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram

. This project will be manually reviewed:

. As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green

. Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).

. For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file

. After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session

. Focus on what you are being asked:

. Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project

. Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements

. Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details 
is necessary - speaking too much can play against you

. In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
