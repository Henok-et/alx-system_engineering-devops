# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

# project overview 
The "0x10. HTTPS SSL DevOps SysAdmin Security" project is a comprehensive endeavor focused on enhancing web security through the implementation of HTTPS SSL certificates. This project adheres to strict requirements, including the use of allowed editors such as vi, vim, or emacs, and running all scripts on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Every file within the project must conclude with a new line, and a README.md file placed at the root of the project folder is mandatory for documentation purposes. Notably, all Bash scripts must be executable and pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any errors. Additionally, each Bash script should begin with the shebang line #!/usr/bin/env bash and be accompanied by a descriptive comment on the second line, explaining the purpose and functionality of the script. This project embodies a commitment to best practices in DevOps, SysAdmin, and security to ensure the successful implementation of HTTPS SSL for web applications.
