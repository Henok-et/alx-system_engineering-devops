# overview of the project
Project 0x0C, titled "Web Server DevOps SysAdmin," focuses on the development and management of a web server environment while adhering to strict requirements. The project is executed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and emphasizes clean and efficient Bash scripting. All script files are expected to be executable, well-documented with comments, and should pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any issues. The use of editors such as vi, vim, or emacs is permitted. However, one notable limitation is the prohibition of using systemctl for restarting processes, which challenges the SysAdmin's ability to ensure server reliability through alternative means. A mandatory README.md file at the project's root further enhances transparency and documentation, facilitating collaboration and understanding among team members and stakeholders. This project underscores the critical role of DevOps and SysAdmins in maintaining robust and secure web server infrastructures.
