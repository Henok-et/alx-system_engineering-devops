# Describtion
Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in operating systems and DevOps practices. In the context of Shell and Bash scripting, a process refers to a running instance of a program, which can be managed and manipulated through signals. Signals are asynchronous notifications sent to processes to communicate events or request specific actions, like terminating gracefully. DevOps, an approach combining development and operations, relies heavily on scripting to automate tasks and streamline workflows. The Shell and Bash, as popular command-line interfaces, are commonly used for scripting in the Unix/Linux environment. System calls (syscalls) serve as the interface between user-level code and the kernel, enabling processes to request services from the operating system. Leveraging scripting languages and understanding process management and signal handling are essential skills for efficient DevOps practices in modern computing environments.
