Regular Expression (Regex) is a powerful and versatile sequence of characters used to define search patterns and manipulate text in various programming languages and text editors. It enables developers and system administrators to efficiently search, match, and replace specific strings within a larger body of text, providing a flexible and concise way to perform complex text operations. In the context of DevOps, Regex plays a crucial role in automating tasks, such as parsing logs, filtering data, and validating input, making it an indispensable tool for improving efficiency and consistency in continuous integration and deployment processes.
